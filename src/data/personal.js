    bio: "I build with the end user in mind. Whether developing new products, improving existing ones, or collaborating with cross-functional teams, I combine technical depth with user research and data-driven decision making to create solutions that make a real difference in people's lives. I've spent the last 5 years exploring computer science—from machine learning to full-stack development—always focused on solving meaningful problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, skiing, playing guitar, or discovering live music.",
