    bio: "I'm a passionate developer who always codes with the end user in mind. I love building services that make a difference in people's lives, whether that means developing new ideas, innovating on existing ones, or simply making sure end-users are getting the most out of their products. I've spent the last 5 years exploring all areas of computer science, from machine learning to cybersecurity to web development, and I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow. When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking, skiing, playing guitar or listening to music.",
